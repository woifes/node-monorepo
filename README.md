# Overview
This is the monorepo is holding various packages and projects. It is the result of combining different projects which were originally managed by subversion and synchronized with the "externals" feature. During this combination the code bases were mostly rewritten. Most of the projects are intent to use with a mqtt broker.

## Packages
* [alarmhandler](/packages/alarmhandler/) - Simple alarm handler
* [binarytypes](/packages/binarytypes/) - Handles binary datatypes
* [node-yasdi](/packages/node-yasdi/) - Binding package for the yasdi library
* [s7endpoint](/packages/s7endpoint/) - Adapter package for connecting via S7 protocol (RFC1006)
* [util](/packages/util/) - Collection of helper functions, types or classes

## Projects
